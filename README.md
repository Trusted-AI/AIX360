The AI Explainability 360 toolkit is an open-source library that supports interpretability and explainability of datasets and machine learning models. The AI Explainability 360 Python package includes a comprehensive set of algorithms that cover different dimensions of explanations along with proxy explainability metrics.           

The [AI Explainability 360 interactive experience](http://aix360.mybluemix.net/data) provides a gentle introduction to the concepts and capabilities by walking through an example use case for different consumer personas. The [tutorials and example notebooks](./examples) offer a deeper, data scientist-oriented introduction. The complete API is also available. 

There is no single approach to explainability that works best. There are many ways to explain: data vs. model, directly interpretable vs. post hoc explanation, local vs. global, etc. It may therefore be confusing to figure out which algorithms are most appropriate for a given use case. To help, we have created some [guidance material](http://aix360.mybluemix.net/resources#guidance) and a [chart](./aix360/algorithms/README.md) that can be consulted. 

We have developed the package with extensibility in mind. This library is still in development. We encourage the contribution of your explainability algorithms and metrics. To get started as a contributor, please join the [AI Explainability 360 Community on Slack](https://aix360.slack.com) by requesting an invitation [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aix360/shared_invite/enQtNzEyOTAwOTk1NzY2LTM1ZTMwM2M4OWQzNjhmNGRiZjg3MmJiYTAzNDU1MTRiYTIyMjFhZTI4ZDUwM2M1MGYyODkwNzQ2OWQzMThlN2Q).

### Global post-hoc explanationÂ

## Supported explainability metrics
- Faithfulness ([Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola, 2018](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8003-towards-robust-interpretability-with-self-explaining-neural-networks))
- Monotonicity ([Luss et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12698))

## Setup

Supported Configurations:

| OS      | Python version |
| ------- | -------------- |
| macOS   | 3.6  |
| Ubuntu  | 3.6  |
| Windows | 3.6  |

### (Optional) Create a virtual environment

AI Explainability 360 requires specific versions of many Python packages which may conflict
with other projects on your system. A virtual environment manager is strongly
recommended to ensure dependencies may be installed safely. If you have trouble installing the toolkit, try this first.

#### Conda

Conda is recommended for all configurations though Virtualenv is generally
interchangeable for our purposes. Miniconda is sufficient (see [the difference between Anaconda and
Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda)
if you are curious) and can be installed from
[here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) if you do not already have it.

Then, to create a new Python 3.6 environment, run:

```bash
conda create --name aix360 python=3.6
conda activate aix360
```

The shell should now look like `(aix360) $`. To deactivate the environment, run:

```bash
(aix360)$ conda deactivate
```

The prompt will return back to `$ ` or `(base)$`.

Note: Older versions of conda may use `source activate aix360` and `source
deactivate` (`activate aix360` and `deactivate` on Windows).


### Installation

Clone the latest version of this repository:

```bash
(aix360)$ git clone https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360
```

If you'd like to run the examples and tutorial notebooks, download the datasets now and place them in
their respective folders as described in
[aix360/data/README.md](aix360/data/README.md).

Then, navigate to the root directory of the project which contains `setup.py` file and run:

```bash
(aix360)$ pip install -e .
```

## Running in Docker

* Under `AIX360` directory build the container image from Dockerfile using `docker build -t aix360_docker .`
* Start the container image using command `docker run -it -p 8888:8888 aix360_docker:latest bash` assuming port 8888 is free on your machine.
* Inside the container start jupuyter lab using command `jupyter lab --allow-root --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser`
* Access the sample tutorials on your machine using URL `localhost:8888`

## PIP Installation of AI Explainability 360

If you would like to quickly start using the AI explainability 360 toolkit without cloning this repository, then you can install the [aix360 pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/aix360/) as follows. 

```bash
(your environment)$ pip install aix360
```

If you follow this approach, you may need to download the notebooks in the [examples](./examples) folder separately. 


## Using AI Explainability 360

The `examples` directory contains a diverse collection of jupyter notebooks
that use AI Explainability 360 in various ways. Both examples and tutorial notebooks illustrate
working code using the toolkit. Tutorials provide additional discussion that walks
the user through the various steps of the notebook. See the details about
tutorials and examples [here](examples/README.md).
