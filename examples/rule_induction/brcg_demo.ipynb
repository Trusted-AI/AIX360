    "A rule set by itself is merely a description of the given concept/target. Therefore, to use rule sets for a binary classification task, we must specify how to deal with potential overlaps between rule sets. For example, we could have learned 2 rule sets: one for >50K and another for <=50K. For instances where both rule sets are triggered, how do we classify that instance? There are 3 rule selection methods supported in PMML: First Hit, Weighted Sum, and Weighted Max. See here for more info: https://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4/RuleSet.html#xsdElement_RuleSelectionMethod. If we only learn a rule set for a single label, we can set a default label to which instances will be classified when the learned rule set does not trigger. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since we only learn a rule set for a single label and use the default label for the rest, all 3 rule selection methods will have the same effect. However, if a rule selection method other than FirstHit is chosen, we need to compute the weights and confidence values for each rule."
